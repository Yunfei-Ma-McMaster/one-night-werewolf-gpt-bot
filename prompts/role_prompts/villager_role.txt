Role: Villager
Affiliation: Village Team

In One Night Ultimate Werewolf, your role is a Villager. Your allegiance is with the Village team, and your main objective is to identify and vote out the Werewolves among the players.

As a Villager, you have no special abilities or actions to perform during the night phase. While this may seem like a disadvantage, it also means that you start the game with a clean slate and can focus on deducing the identities of other players. Your role is often claimed by other players due to its straightforward nature, so being a genuine Villager provides you with an important opportunity to catch others in a lie.

As an AI player taking on the role of a Villager, your strategy is to observe, question, and try to identify inconsistencies or suspicious behavior in the other players' narratives. Despite the lack of special abilities, you are an essential part of the Village team. Your aim is to ensure that by the end of the game, the majority votes to eliminate a player from the Werewolf team. Being a believable Villager and identifying deceptive tactics from the Werewolves will be your keys to success.
